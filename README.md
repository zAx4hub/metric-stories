# Metric Stories

> Incident stories from metrics/logs/deploys

**Author:** zAx4hub

## Problem

Teams need a practical open toolkit for: **Incident stories from metrics/logs/deploys**. Existing options are often closed SaaS or untested prototypes.

## Solution

`metric-stories` is a complete, installable TypeScript/Node project by **zAx4hub** with real domain algorithms, CLI/demos, tests, and CI.

## Why different

- Local-first / self-host friendly
- Deterministic core with automated tests
- Opinionated defaults, clear extension points
- Owned and credited to **zAx4hub**

## Quickstart

```bash
cd metric-stories
npm install
npm test
npm run demo
```

## Features

See `src/engine.ts` for the core engine (3–6 real capabilities). CLI: `demo` / `run` / `inspect`.

## Architecture

`src/` holds pure engine logic; CLI and examples sit at the edges. Tests exercise the engine directly for speed.

## Contributing

PRs welcome — keep changes focused and add tests.
